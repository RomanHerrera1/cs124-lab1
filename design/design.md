## Design Decisions
One of the first design decisions that we made was to make the page itself look similar to a notepad. This was to make using the webpage to be analagous to writing to-do notes down on paper. We chose colors typical to most notepads in order to mirror this decision. Another way we implemented this idea was by having the actual body of the to-do list be left-justified, reflecting the convention of English to be written and read from left-to-right. If we were to implement this for languages read and written from right-to-left, we would have instead made our items be right-justified. In fact, we decided to have the items on our page be left-aligned in general, as that is where users will likely scan their eyes first. Furthermore, we felt that to-do lists should be very clean and easy to look at, so we chose to have the general look of the webpage be very minimal so as not to feel too distracting for the user.

Another decision we made was about buttons. 
- In regards to placement, we felt that it would make the most sense to have the "Create new item" button be right underneath the list itself, and have newly added items appear right above it. As for the "Rename", "Show Uncompleted", and "Delete All Completed" buttons, we decided to have it grouped together at the bottom of the page as they each can affect multiple list items at once, and thus have somewhat similar functionality. 
- We also decided that when a button is "in use", the buttons would stay in the same place but have their text modified to show that an action is taking place (for ex. the Rename button changes its text to "Done" upon click, and back to "Rename" once the user clicks it again).

## Alternative Designs

- having the bottom three buttons be top right 
- having a + button next to the item to "add" it when creating new item 
- rename individual text boxes instead of having it possible to rename all at once

## User Testing

- havent done user testing yet, but Roman and I plan to eventually

## Challenges Faced

- biggest challenge was probably working to get the buttons and boxes all placed exactly where we wanted them to be placed. As well as having the color properly be fitted to the header

## Designs Most Proud Of

- Could talk with roman about this, but maybe having the rename feature do it so that all the list items could be renamed at once. Maybe also having the three buttons together?
