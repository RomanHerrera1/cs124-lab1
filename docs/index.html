      <h2>Creating a New Item</h2>
      <h3>An empty list</h3>
      <img src="createitem_pre.png" alt="Create Item Pre Image">
      <p>This shows an empty list. Now we want to press the button "Create new item +"
        to add something to our list. Let us add "Buy new John Grisham book" to our list.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Create new item +"</h3>
      <img src="createitem_mid.png" alt="Create Item Mid Image">
      <p>After pressing the button, a text input box shows up that we enter our task into.
        Let us add "Buy new John Grisham book" into the text input box. Once we are
        finished typing out the task we want to add, we press the "Add" button.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Add"</h3>
      <img src="createitem_post.png" alt="Create Item Post Image">
      <p>After pressing the button, the text will be added to the list. In our case, we
        pressed the "Add" button, and now we get "Buy new John Grisham book" as an activity
        on our list that we can check off when we are done with it.</p>

      <h2>Adding an Additional New Item</h2>
      <h3>A non-empty list</h3>
      <img src="eatlunch_pre.png" alt="Eat Lunch Pre Image">
      <p>This shows a non-empty list, and in our case, we have  "Buy new John Grisham book"
        as a list item already. Now we want to add another item, say "Eat Lunch". First, we
        press the button "Create new item +" to add another task to our list.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Create new item +"</h3>
      <img src="eatlunch_mid.png" alt="Eat Lunch Mid Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Create new item +" button, a text input box shows up under the
        rest of the list. We type our task into that box. Let us add "Eat Lunch" into the text input
        box. Once we are finished typing out the task we want to add, we press the "Add" button.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Add"</h3>
      <img src="eatlunch_post.png" alt="Eat Lunch Post Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Add" button, the text will be added to the list as another checkbox.
        Notice that the list maintains the order in which the tasks were added. In our case, we
        pressed the "Add" button, and now we get "Eat Lunch" as an activity on our list that we can
        check off when we are done with it.</p>

    <div class = "threeimg" id = "callmom">
      <h2>Marking an Item As Completed</h2>
      <h3>A non-empty list</h3>
      <img src="callmom_pre.png" alt="Call Mom Pre Image">
      <p>This shows a non-empty list, and in our case, we have "Call Mom"
        as a list item already. Now we want to mark the item as complete.
      Simply press the checkbox or the list item name to mark it as done.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the checkbox or task</h3>
      <img src="callmom_post.png" alt="Call Mom Post Image">
      <p>After pressing the pressing the checkbox or the text itself,
      the task is complete. This is visually represented by the checked checkbox
      but also the strikethrough of the task so you know to move onto other tasks.</p>

    <div class = "threeimg" id = "rename">
      <h2>Renaming an Existing Item</h2>
      <h3>A non-empty list</h3>
      <img src="rename_pre.png" alt="Renaming Pre Image">
      <p>This shows a non-empty list, and in our case, we have "Text John" and "Eat Lunch"
        as list items already. Now we want to rename "Text John" to "Text John about the bank
        statements. First, we press the button "Rename".</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Rename"</h3>
      <img src="rename_mid.png" alt="Renaming Mid Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Rename" button, text input boxes reappear for each entry of the list.
        Note that the text boxes will start filled in already with the tasks prior to renaming.
        This gives the option to rename any of the items at this point. To rename the "Text John" task,
        we click into the text box that contains "Text John" and type our new task name into that box.
        Let us change the text to "Text John about bank statements" in the text input box.
        Once we are finished renaming all the items, we press the "Done" button that exists where
        the "Rename" button was prior to pressing.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Done"</h3>
      <img src="rename_post.png" alt="Renaming Post Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Done" button, the text boxes will disappear. All unchanged task items will
        appear as they did before. The items we renamed however reflect the changes.
        The items will all be checkboxes again, and will maintain the order they were in before.
      Also note that the "Rename" button reappears in its previous spot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "threeimg" id = "showuncompleted">
      <h2>Showing Only Uncompleted Items</h2>
      <h3>A non-empty list</h3>
      <img src="showuncompleted_pre.png" alt="Show Uncompleted Pre Image">
      <p>This shows a non-empty list, and in our case, we have "Text John" and "Eat Lunch"
        as list items already. In this case, since "Text John" is checked off and has
        strikethrough, we know that it is completed. Let's say we want to show only uncompleted
      tasks so we can better focus on what we need to do. First, press the "Show Uncompleted" button.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Show Uncompleted"</h3>
      <img src="showuncompleted_post.png" alt="Show Uncompleted Post Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Show Uncompleted" button, all items that were checked off will disappear.
        Note that the space the completed list items had is now taken by uncompleted tasks and that the
        order of uncompleted tasks is maintained from prior. Also, to provide a way to return to
        seeing all tasks, the "Show Uncompleted" button is now a "Show All" button. If pressed, all
        completed tasks will become visible again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "threeimg" id = "delete">
      <h2>Deleting All Completed Tasks</h2>
      <h3>A non-empty list</h3>
      <img src="delete_pre.png" alt="Deleting Pre Image">
      <p>This shows a non-empty list, and in our case, we have "Text John" and "Eat Lunch"
        as list items already. Now we want to remove "Text John" since it has been completed.
        First, we press the button "Delete All Completed".</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Delete All Completed"</h3>
      <img src="delete_mid.png" alt="Deleting Mid Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Delete All Completed" button, nothing will happen except that the
        "Delete All Completed" is now a "Confirm Delete" button. This is to help prevent accidental
        deletions from a mis-click. If you are sure you want to delete the completed tasks, click
        the "Confirm Delete" button.</p>
      <h3>After pressing the button "Confirm Delete"</h3>
      <img src="delete_post.png" alt="Deleting Post Image">
      <p>After pressing the "Confirm Delete" button, all checked off tasks will be deleted. The space
        the completed list items had is now taken by uncompleted tasks and that the order of uncompleted
        tasks is maintained from prior. Note that this is not undoable.</p>
